Thank you for considering to contribute to the Research Software Directory!

There are many ways to contribute, e.g.:

- Write blog posts, tutorials, etc. about the Research Software Directory. Heck, even tweeting about it helps!
- Review any and all parts of the code base including documentation, schemas or anything else you find in there
- Submit bug reports, feature requests; make suggestions
- Correct typos (a one-character diff in a Pull Request is perfectly fine)
- Fork the repository and set up your own custom instance.

However, when participating, we ask that you adhere to some **ground rules**.

Your contribution to the Research Software Directory is valued, and it should be an enjoyable experience.
To ensure this, there is the Research Software Directory 
[Code of Conduct](/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which you are required to follow.
