The is the admin user interface for the Research Software Directory.
It can be used to add and update software items to the directory.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) using scripts package [@nlesc/react-scripts](https://github.com/NLeSC/create-react-app). Original documentation [here](https://github.com/NLeSC/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

# Dependencies

* Auth service e.g. [github-auth](/auth-github).
* Data api service like [backend](/backend).

# Installation

1.  Clone repository
2.  Use node version `^8.0`, eg using [nvm](#install-node-using-nvm)
3.  Install yarn, `npm install -g yarn`
4.  Install dependencies: `yarn`
5.  To run tests: `yarn test`
6.  Start app in dev server: `yarn start`

## Install node using NVM

See https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script

1.  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash
2.  restart terminal
3.  run `nvm install 8`

## Settings

Run-time settings should be reachable through `[BASE_URL]/settings.json`, see e.g. `public/settings.json`.
This settings file should be overriden in production.

# Build

To build the app for production run:

```bash
yarn build
```

The deployable app will build to the `build/` directory.

# Docker

Build with

```bash
docker build --tag rsd_admin .
```

The Docker image should not be used directly and alone as the code expects the [backend server](/backend) to be running at `/api` and the [auth server](/auth-github) to be running at `/auth` which are not part of the image.
The image should be used as part of a Docker compose see https://github.com/research-software-directory/research-software-directory
